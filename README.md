### Hi I'm Tom

I'm a `Scottish software developer`, musician and Burrito lover based in Melbourne, Australia 🇦🇺.

I moved down under 🦘 4 years ago and fell in love with the city’s creative and driven atmosphere. I have traveled a lot and thrive on meeting new people and adapting to different environments.

I have always had a burning curiosity for tech, coding, and programming. My general want for growth and upskilling as well as interest in problem-solving meant that last year I took the leap and learned to code with Le Wagon on their 6-month Full Stack Development Bootcamp. I’m always looking to learn more and I’m constantly looking to improve my skillset.

I now work closely with the Le Wagon team in Melbourne as a Teacher Assistant. 🚀

Outside of coding, I love coffee, beer and travel. ☕️
